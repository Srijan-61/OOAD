# Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) for Inventory Management System

[cite_start]This repository hosts the Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) documentation for an Inventory Management System, completed as an individual coursework for a Software Engineering module. [cite: 2]

## Project Overview

The `23056358_Srijan_Bhandari_OOAD_Report.pdf` document details the comprehensive analysis and design phases of a software project. It includes:

- **Planning Diagrams:**
    - [cite_start]Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) [cite: 2]
    - [cite_start]Gantt Charts [cite: 2]
- **OOAD Diagrams:**
    - [cite_start]Use Case Diagram [cite: 2]
    - [cite_start]Communication Diagram [cite: 2]
    - [cite_start]Activity Diagram [cite: 2]
    - [cite_start]Class Diagram (and more) [cite: 2]

This documentation demonstrates the application of structured software engineering principles and Agile methodologies in the design phase of a system.

## Tools Used

- Agile methodologies
- Team Gantt (for Gantt Charts)
- Figma (for UI/UX design or prototyping, if applicable, based on prior context)
- Draw.io (for creating diagrams like Use Case, Communication, Activity, and Class Diagrams)
